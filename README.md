In the data folder are the source and target language datasets (en and nl respectively). Those are already transformed, you don't need to run text_transform.py on them.


The raw data files are .ignored so you have to download the europal files yourself! (from http://www.statmt.org/europarl/v7/nl-en.tgz)
